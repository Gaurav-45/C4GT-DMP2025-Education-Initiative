# Education Initiative Angular Component Library - Storybook Implementation

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is part of **Code4GovTech Dedicated Mentoring Program (DMP) 2025**, where I contributed to the Education Initiative organization's Angular Component Library by implementing comprehensive Storybook documentation and revamping existing components.

> **Note**: The original repository is hosted on a private Bitbucket repository. This documentation serves as evidence of my contributions through merged PR screenshots and working application demonstrations/screenshots.

## 📋 About the Project

The **Education Initiative Angular Component Library** is a comprehensive collection of reusable UI components designed specifically for educational platforms and learning management systems. The library includes:

- **Primary Components**: Basic building blocks (Buttons, Text Fields, Icons, Modals, Charts)
- **Secondary Components**: Complex composed components (Cards, Question Types, Performance Analytics)
- **Theme System**: Consistent color palette and styling using CSS variables
- **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features and keyboard navigation
- **Tailwind Integration**: Utility-first CSS framework integration

## 🎯 My Contributions

### 3. Quality Standards Implementation

I established and implemented comprehensive quality standards for all stories:

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Component Descriptions**: Clear explanations of purpose and use cases
- **Argument Documentation**: Detailed prop descriptions with proper categorization
- **Default Values**: Realistic defaults showcasing component capabilities
- **Interactive Controls**: Proper control types (text, select, boolean, color, object)

#### Standard Categories System
```typescript
'Content'           // Text, data, content-related props
'Appearance'        // Visual styling and variants  
'State'            // Interactive states (disabled, loading, etc.)
'Styling'          // CSS classes and custom styling
'Layout'           // Size, positioning, layout props
'Validation'       // Form validation and error states
'Progress'         // Progress indicators and tracking
'Events'           // Component outputs and callbacks
'Advanced'         // Complex configurations
'Validation Colors' // Color props for validation states
```

### 4. Component Revamping

I also worked on revamping several existing components to improve:
- **Functionality**: Created new components as per the V2 Figma designs
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and event handling
- **Consistency**: Standardized prop naming and component patterns
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Storybook Configuration
- Configured Storybook 7.x with Angular support
- Implemented automatic documentation generation
- Set up interactive controls and actions logging
- Added responsive design testing capabilities

### Utility Functions
I created and utilized the `argsToTemplate` utility for clean template generation:

```typescript
// Basic usage
${argsToTemplate(args)}

// With complex object binding (essential for data-heavy components)
${argsToTemplate(args, { bind: ['questionData', 'validationStatus', 'theme'] })}

// Excluding specific properties
${argsToTemplate(args, { exclude: ['buttonClicked'] })}
```
